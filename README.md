[FikaMed](https://mervekucukzoroglu.github.io/FikaMed/) is a digital friend chat bot for immediate support to mental health patients. This platform provides users to understand what they feel and what they can do to calm down and feel better eventually. FikaMed approaches users friendly and addresses them with their names after the users enters their name. The control is in the hands of user and they decide the next step of FikaMed, based on which button they click. The last stage always has a feedback form as well.

FikaMed also has a timer, starts when user clicks on it, to do meditation for one minute. If they feel so, they could repeat this stage as many times as the user wants. This timer is displayed if the user tells FikaMed that they feel angry. 

This platform wishes to be an immediate support to deal with one's emotions. However, if the user needs a medical support they should consult a professional doctor.
